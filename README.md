# PID-Deaign-Delay-toolbox
The PID-Design-Delay toolbox is a MATLAB-based toolbox. It consider a general case where the three controller gains (${k_P}$, ${k_I}$, and ${k_D}$) and the delay ($\tau$) are all treated as free parameters. The user is only required to input the necessary information via the graphical user interface (GUI) and then the stability analysis may be automatically fulfilled by the toolbox.
